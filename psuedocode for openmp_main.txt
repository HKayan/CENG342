Begin
  Parse command line arguments for input_image, output_image, and num_threads

  Load input_image into memory and get its dimensions and channels
  
  Check if the image dimensions are divisible by 2
  
  Compute new dimensions for the output_image
  
  Allocate memory for the output_image

  Set the number of threads for OpenMP to num_threads
  
  Start timer

  # Parallel section begins
  Begin Parallel Region
    Call the resizing function on input_image with new dimensions, outputting to output_image
  End Parallel Region
  # Parallel section ends

  Stop timer and compute elapsed time

  Check if resizing operation was successful
  
  Write output_image to file
  
  Free allocated memory for both input_image and output_image
  
  Print elapsed time and success message
End
